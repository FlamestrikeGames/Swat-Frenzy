# Swat-Frenzy

**Game Mechanics**

Swat Frenzy is a game that spawns enemies randomly on the screen and moves them to a random location on the screen for a random duration of time (a couple seconds). Players must then swipe these enemies off of the screens, moving them based on how far away they began swiping so that players cannot just swipe on top of enemies. Some enemies could take several swipes as they are more resilient or the player makes weak swipes on the enemy. If the player fails to swipe the enemy off the screen in time, they take damage based on the enemy. To beat the game, the player must complete all 9 levels. Each level is unique and some have wooden boards on the screen that cannot be swiped over.

All sprites in this game were created by using Piskel.
